> A spike is a product development method originating from extreme programming that uses the simplest possible program to explore potential solutions.[1] It is used to determine how much work will be required to solve or work around a software issue. Typically, a "spike test" involves gathering additional information or testing for easily reproduced edge cases. The term is used in agile software development approaches like Scrum or Extreme Programming.
